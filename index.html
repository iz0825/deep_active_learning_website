            <p id="p1"> Elisa Chotzoglou is currently with the Department of Computing at Imperial College London. She obtained her B.Sc and M.Sc from Department of Computer Science and Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering departments respectively. She has been research assistant on multimodal deep learning and deep learning for genomics. Her research interests include machine learning, medical image analysis, computer vision and anomaly detection. </p>
            <h2 id="subheading2">Past Research</h2>
            <p id="p2"> Elisa's past research was mainly oriented around: </p>
            <ul class="researchList">
              <li>Research on multimodal <span class="DL">Deep Learning</span>. <span class="DL">Deep Learning</span> architectures such as Restricted Boltzmann machines and autoencoders, Convolutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural networks (LSTMs) are used to learn a common latent space from multimodal data. Implementation of a multimodal retrieval system for text, image, speech using the above methods.</li>
              <li><span class="DL">Deep Learning</span> for Genomics. Use convolutional autoencoders and LSTMs for detection, clustering and classification of patterns from nucleotides sequences in cells. Implementation using tensorflow framework.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>But what is deep learning?</h3>
            <p id="p3">Nowadays, machine learning technology has been integrated into our daily lives, from content filtering, personalised recommendations on social networks to image recognition. Often, such technologies need to be able to identify main components of images, select relevant data and information, translate speech into text and so on. Instead of the conventional machine learning algorithms that require large amount of human efforts and specific information related to each activity, deep learning is a form of representation learning that allows the machines to take in raw data input and transform it into more abstract representation, in order to help future processes. The main idea behind this is to transform the data - for example, an image - one step at a time until reaching the highest abstract level. The most promising advantage deep learning methods bring is that the algorithm will be able to use a general-purpose learning algorithm to train itself to process the data. <sup><a href="#reference">[1]</a></sup>

            <h2 id="subheading3">Motivation</h2>
            <p id="p4">The motivation that fuels Elisa Chotzoglou's research lies within her true desire to generate a significant, and lasting impact in society. A particular field of interest of hers is using the techniques encompassed in Deep learning in order to help produce rigorous methods and technologies to be used in the diagnosis of cancers. It is certainly true that this would have it’s remarkable impact in society, as the more efficient and accurate methods would surely provide a more stable means of efficiently diagnosing people, and therefore allowing quicker and more informed decisions to be made in effort to combat them.</p>
            <p id="p5">With Elisa Chotzoglou's background, there was quite an extent when it comes to what she could have decided to specialized in. With the rising emphasis on computation in effectively every industry, there were a range of particular industries that she could've specialised in. However, the option to not only produce something that had the potential to help countless people in the medical industry, but also to actually venture into a whole new field of academia was too tempting.</p>
